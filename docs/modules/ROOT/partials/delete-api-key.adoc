== Delete an API Key

WARNING: If you delete your API key, any application using the key will not work unless you update the configuration with a new set of credentials.

To create a set of API credentials, do the following:

. Sign into the link:{page-cloud-console}[{hazelcast-cloud} console,window=_blank]
. Select *Account* from the side navigation bar
. Select *Developer* from the *Account* options
+
The Developer screen displays.

. Select the *Delete API Key* button
+
A confirmation dialog box displays.

. Select the *OK* button to delete your API key. Selecting the *Cancel* button returns you to the Developer screen without deleting your API key

If you want to continue using your applications with Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud}, you must create an API key again and ensure that your applications are correctly configured to use the updated API credentials.
