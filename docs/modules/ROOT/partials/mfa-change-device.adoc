=== Change Authenticator Device

Verification codes are specific to a particular device and cannot be transferred. If you use a different device, you cannot use the codes even if they are generated from the same authentication app. 

To change the device used by your authentication app, complete the following steps:

. <<disable, Disable MFA>> on your old device
. <<enable, Enable MFA>> on your new device

You can now use your authenticator app on your new device.
