= Configuring Distributed Data Structures
:description: Hazelcast offers distributed implementations of common data structures. From the {hazelcast-cloud} console, you can create new custom configurations or modify the default configuration for these data structures.
:page-aliases: list.adoc, multimap.adoc, reliable-topic.adoc, replicated-map.adoc, ringbuffer.adoc, set.adoc

{description}

Consider using the following data structures when building your application.

|Data structure |Description|Settings|Default Configuration

|xref:map-configurations.adoc[Map]
|Key-value pairs that are distributed across partitions in a cluster. Distributed maps, also known as IMaps or maps, make it easier to scale your applications while protecting against member failures. Maps support SQL-like queries.
|See xref:map-configurations.adoc[Map Configuration]
|See xref:hazelcast:data-structures:map-config.adoc#hazelcast-map-configuration-defaults[Hazelcast Map Configuration Defaults]

|xref:jcache.adoc[JCache]
|Hazelcast's specification-compliant JCache implementation. JCache allows you to store frequently accessed data in memory and to access, update, and delete the data efficiently across partitions in a cluster.
|See xref:jcache.adoc[JCache Configuration]
|See xref:hazelcast:jcache:setup.adoc#configuring-for-jcache[Configuring JCache]

|xref:queue.adoc[Queue]
|All clients and cluster members can interact with a queue. Add an item to the queue in one cluster member and remove it from another member with another client. 
|See xref:queue.adoc[Queue Configuration]
|See xref:hazelcast:data-structures:queue.adoc#configuring-queue[Configuring Queue]

|xref:topic.adoc[Topic]
|All clients and cluster members can publish topics for consumption by subscribers, and subscribe to topics published by other clients and cluster members.
|See xref:topic.adoc[Topic Configuration]
|See xref:hazelcast:data-structures:topic.adoc#configuring-topic[Configuring Topic]
