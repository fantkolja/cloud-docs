= Sample JDBC Client
:description: Hazelcast provides a sample JDBC client, which you can use to create a custom client.

{description}

== Get the Sample Client

Download the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cloud-java-sample-client/blob/master/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/cloud/ClientWithSsl.java[sample client^] from GitHub.

You also need the  _hazelcast-jdbc-enterprise-{version}.jar_ file. You can download this file from https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jdbc/releases[Releases^].

A JDBC Driver allows a Java application to connect to Hazelcast using the JDBC API. The Hazelcast JDBC Driver is available from https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jdbc[GitHub^]. 

== Configure the Client

To configure the JDBC client for {hazelcast-cloud}, you must update the _pom.xml_ file included in the sample JDBC client.

In this file, add the JAR dependency, as follows:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
        <artifactId>hazelcast-jdbc-enterprise</artifactId>
        <version>5.3.1</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

You must also specify the repository, as follows:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>hazelcast-release</id>
        <name>Hazelcast Repository</name>
        <url>https://repository.hazelcast.com/release/</url>
        <releases>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
        </releases>
    </repository>
</repositories>
----

== Connect to Your Cluster

Connect your JDBC client to your {hazelcast-cloud} cluster using the following URL:

[source]
----
jdbc:hazelcast://<cluster-id>/?discoveryToken=<yourDiscoveryToken>&cloudUrl=https://api.viridian.hazelcast.com&sslEnabled=true
----

This can be understood as follows:

* `jdbc:hazelcast` A required sub-protocol. This is a constant
* `<cluster-id>` The ID of your cluster as displayed at the top right of the *Cluster Details* in the dashboard for the cluster in your link:{page-cloud-console}[{hazelcast-cloud} console,window=_blank] 
* `discoveryToken` Set this to the discovery token created with your cluster. To find your discovery token select *CONNECT CLUSTER*. The discovery token can be revealed using the *Advanced setup* tab
* `cloudURL` This must be set to the API base URL, `\https://api.viridian.hazelcast.com`. As TLS is mandatory, you must also enable SSL by appending `&sslEnabled=true` to the cloud URL

For further information on the connection properties used by the Hazelcast JDBC driver, refer to the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jdbc/blob/main/README.md[READ ME^] file.
