== Creating a New Mapping

You can only create a single mapping to any IMap. If a mapping for a specific IMap already appears in the Data Explorer of the SQL browser, you cannot create another mapping to it.

. Sign into the link:{page-cloud-console}[{hazelcast-cloud} console, window=blank].
. Select the cluster where the IMap data has been written.
. In the left navigation, select *SQL* to open the SQL browser.
. In the *Data Explorer*, click *Connector Wizard* and select the *Hazelcast Map* connector.
. In *Choose Resources*, select the IMap that you want to query.
. Click *Generate Mapping Command* to generate the SQL required to create the new mapping. You're ready to start querying your data.
